# Bouncing balls simulator

This is a **one-day project** I created to train my skills in **SFML** and **C++ OOP**. I applied the mechanical concepts of **gravity**, **momentum**, and **elasticity** to make the ball's behavior as realistic as possible. The result is a fun and interactive simulation where balls behave like they would in real life.

## How to Play
- Simply **click with the left mouse button** to drop balls into the simulation.
- Watch them react to gravity, bounce off walls, and collide with each other.

## How to Run

You can easily run this project directly in **Visual Studio**:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the `.sln` file in Visual Studio.
3. Build and run the project.

## Technologies Used

- **SFML**: For graphics, window management, and handling input.
- **C++**: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to structure the project.
